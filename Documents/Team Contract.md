# Team Contract

## Communication
1. We will meet once a week on Fridays in person for a few hours to discuss what we worked on in the past week and continue working. We will make a log of our meetings and record what happened.

2. If a team member needs help, they can send everyone a message to the group. Everyone will be expected to respond within 24 hours.

3. We will ensure that each person contributes equally by having each person give their opinion during meetings and for tasks. By doing this, we will make sure that everyone listens and engages with the thoughts of others.

## Collaboration

4. We will divide different parts of the project between the team members. By doing this, we will be able to have each person work to their strengths and then come together to put everyone's work together. If we encounter unexpected complications or unforseen work, we will talk with each to resolve it, and if needed, contact our mentor for additional help.

5. Each group member is expected to work for around 3 hours per week to ensure that their goals for the week are met. There are no prior commitments that will need to be accounted for. If any new conflicts arise, we will communicate and meet as needed to resolve them. 

6. If there is a disagreement between members, we will talk with each other to resolve it. We do not forsee people not accomplishing tasks or being late since we all know each other and will communicate regularly. If needed, we will contact our mentor/course staff.
